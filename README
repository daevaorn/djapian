This package (backend only) is a replacement (fork) of django.contrib.search 
(branch search-api), the original documentation can be found at:

http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/TextIndexingAbstractionLayer

The focus of this package is 100% based on Xapian (http://www.xapian.org), but feel free
to do the changes and allow it work with Lucene and Hype (the original propose 
of the search-api)

You need xapian-core and xapian-binding with python enabled to use this module
